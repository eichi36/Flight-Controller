# Flight-Controller
Hi there, I want to build a (fpv) Quadcopter with my own developed Flight Controller.

I have recently just started with my hobby project. At that stage I am writing the first drivers e.g.
for an Accelerometer / Gyroscope and an ESC. Therefore, the Nucleo-F767ZI board from STM.


As you might see, I am very new to that topic and I have much to learn, but this is my main goal I want to achieve.
It is a very time-intensive hobby project, so I will keep me a while busy...
